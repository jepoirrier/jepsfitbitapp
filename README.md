Jep's Fitbit "app"

Various R scripts to read data from Fitbit trackers

Fitbit: http://www.fitbit.com
Jep: http://jepoirrier.org

Note: when you register an app it should be a web app (and not a desktop one)

Scritps are usually described and commented.

Little convention: *.pwd files contains real life password and are not distributed.
Fill in *.pwd-example and save them as *.pwd for the various scripts to work.
